Below are the step used to print the Pascal triangle.

Step - 1: Taking input from the user to get the number of rows.

Step - 2: Declare an empty list that will store the values.

Step - 3: Using for loop, which will iterate through 0 to n - 1, append the sub-lists to the list.

Step - 4: Now append 1 to the list.

Step - 5: Now, use for loop to define the value of the number inside the triangle adjacent row.

Step - 6: Print Pascal triangle according to the format.

Step - 7: Exit
